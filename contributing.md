# Contributing to Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service Documentation

Thank you for choosing to contribute to Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service documentation! We welcome content contributions from our entire reader community as well as from fellow Adobe employees.

This file describes how you can contribute as well as points out the guidelines to follow when making your contributions.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

[](code-of-conduct.md) By contributing to AEM documentation, you agree to adhere to this code of conduct. [](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com)

## Guidelines for Contributing

While we welcome any contributions to improve AEM documentation, we do ask that contributions adhere to certain guidelines and standards where possible. [](guidelines.md)

## How to Contribute

We want to make it as easy as possible to submit your contributions. You can contribute in two ways:

* [Create an issue](#create-an-issue)
* [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request)

Which method you choose depends on how comfortable you are editing the documentation in GitHub yourself.

### Create an Issue {#create-an-issue}

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? Then please create an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contribute, but don&#39;t feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

Issues allow you to easily describe your idea for improvement to the docs and an AEM Docs Team member can review it. ****

### Create a Pull Request {#create-a-pull-request}

If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests allow you to make your own edits to the documentation, which are then reviewed for inclusion by an AEM Docs Team member. ****

[](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html)  Detta ger Adobe tillstånd att återdistribuera dina bidrag som en del av projektet. You only need to submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go!

### Quick Video Introduction

Have a look at the following video for a quick overview of how to create issues and pull requests.

### Contributions from Adobe Employees

`AdobeDocs`

We of course are happy for any contribution and will review your contribution if it is made on the public repository, however pull requests from Adobe employees are easier to process and can be approved faster on the corporate repo. Please make sure that any proprietary information is only discussed on the corporate repo.
